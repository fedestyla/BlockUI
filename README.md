BlockUI
=======

it's so easy to write an app that completely block Android that you can't believe it!

You will able to deactivate the app only unistalling by adb with the command:

adb uninstall packageName

I suggest to install it on emulator so you can easily destroy it and recreate.

BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL IF YOU DECIDE TO INSTALL IT ON YOUR PHONE. DO THAT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
